### NHGP
* When finish RW_KRR and MSE of SK, then do this, need to finish before next spring

### MSE convergence of SK
* Draft document
  * Misspecification theorem
  * High-dimensional result, find the high-probability bound
  * polish draft, change symbols
* Experiments
  * low-dimensional, validate the slope
  * high-dimensional, apply smolyak and separable kernel;
                      compare with low-dimension and other high-dimensional methods

### RW-KRR
* Draft
  * Put theoretical and numerical parts together
  * Implement exponential kernel's results
* Experiments
  * See $\lambda$ influence
  * Fix totoal budget $B$, see $n$ with error
  * Add a GP benchmark function
